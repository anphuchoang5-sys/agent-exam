# Task 05 T2: the half of the seven assertions that must run *inside* Harbor's workload
# container, given as that Trial's command.
#
# Why this is not topology-probe.sh: that one creates the containers itself (pure Docker
# layer, T1). Here Harbor creates them and this script only observes -- the container it
# runs in is the workload, the proxy and fake upstream are sibling services, and the
# readings that need the Docker API (published ports, mounts, the private file, cleanup)
# are taken on the host after the run, as the runbook's appendix three requires.
#
# It prints raw readings, then its own PASS/FAIL verdicts alongside the same expectation
# names topology-verdicts.sh uses, so the two lists can be reviewed together. It never
# loosens an expectation to make a run pass.
#
# It is run inside the fixed Harbor workload for T2; host-side Docker evidence is separate.
#
# Environment (set them in the Trial command; defaults match the shape in runbook appendix
# three, where the services are named proxy and fake-upstream):
#   T05_PROXY_HOST        default proxy            T05_PROXY_PORT        default 8080
#   T05_UPSTREAM_HOST     default fake-upstream    T05_UPSTREAM_PORT     default 8080
#   T05_OTHER_TRIAL_HOST  default t05-other-trial  T05_OTHER_TRIAL_PORT  default 6379
#   T05_PRIVATE_MARKER    default FAKE-T05-PROVIDER-SECRET
#   T05_SENTINEL          default FAKE-T05-CLIENT-TOKEN
#   T05_PRIVATE_PATH      default /opt/agentexam-private/fake-provider.json (the provider
#                         file stays on the host; the workload asserts it is not visible here)
