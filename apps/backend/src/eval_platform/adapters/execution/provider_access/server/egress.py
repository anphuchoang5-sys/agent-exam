"""The only place the proxy opens a socket: one HTTPS POST, exactly once.

The request type already refuses retrying and following redirects; this module adds the
socket facts — one connection, one attempt, a read timeout — and turns whatever the
upstream answers into a fixed code instead of a second call. No byte of the answer is
logged, kept or reinterpreted: the body is handed to the caller unchanged.

This module does not decide which client headers travel. `service` drops the headers the
proxy's own inbound connection owns and `request_policy` forwards only its whitelisted
set, so `OutboundRequest.headers` is already the minimal business set and nothing here
can collide with the `Host`, `Content-Length` and `Accept-Encoding` the library adds.

The connector is injectable because the proxy-to-upstream leg must be TLS while the fake
upstream is plain HTTP: the integration slice supplies the wrapper, and no path here
pretends that wrapper already exists.
